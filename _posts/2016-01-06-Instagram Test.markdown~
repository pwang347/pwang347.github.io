<h1>Project description</h1>
This was my first try at Ruby on Rails. For this project, I followed various tutorials and used gems such as Devise and Paperclip to achieve functionalities similar to Instagram. The uploaded images are stored to my DropBox account via the developer API.   

(<i>Fun fact</i>: The amount of Windows-only issues that I ran into during this project was enough to convince me to set up a virtual programming environment running on Ubuntu, which I am currently using to develop this Jekyll site.)
