<h1>Project description</h1>
Inspired by Discord, I created a chatroom service that implements text-to-speech (TTS) functionality. My main goal for this project was to familiarize myself with the Node JS framework, but I might return to add more features in the future.

<h1>Responsibilities</h1>
<ul>
<li>Designed CSS styling and html layout</li>
<li>Implemented chat and storage functionality</li>
<li>Forked Say.js repository, added bugfix for stopping TTS on Windows</li>
</ul>
