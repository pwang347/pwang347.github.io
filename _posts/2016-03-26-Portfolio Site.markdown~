<h1>Project description</h1>
This is the site that you're looking at right now. I was encouraged by a friend to create a static portfolio site using Jekyll. In the future, I may also extend this site to include a blog. As a base, this site uses the Strata Jekyll theme with a few tweaks in layout and styling.
