<h1>Project description</h1>
I completed this project in high school on request for a friend who owned a local lunch-selling service. This was one of my first programming projects, and I wanted to learn more about programming by designing a simple app where most of the work could be completed by drag and drop. 

<h1>Responsibilities</h1>
<ul>
<li>Implemented user interaction events</li>
<li>Created database tables (eg. Menu, Customers, Orders)</li>
<li>Developed user interface in Visual Studio</li>
</ul>
