<h1>Project description</h1>
This project was completed in my early years of high school on behalf of a friend's mom who owned a local lunch-selling service. As one of my first programming projects, I wanted to learn more about programming by designing a simple GUI app where I could simply work on the visuals using drag and drop (ie. to spend more time for developing functionality). 

<h1>Responsibilities</h1>
<ul>
<li>Implemented user interaction events</li>
<li>Created database tables (eg. Menu, Customers, Orders) and wrote SQL statements to retrieve data</li>
<li>Developed user interface using Visual Basic</li>
</ul>
