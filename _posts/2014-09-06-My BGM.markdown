<h1>Project description</h1>
My BGM was the first Android app and personal project that I completed in Java. It is a free media player app that allows you to customize your own music playlists for different actions, locations and moods. The goal was to familiarize myself with both object-oriented programming and also the Android development process, which includes understanding the app lifecycle and managing intents and activities.

<h1>Responsibilities</h1>
<ul>
<li>Modeled core classes used in the app (eg. Song, Playlist, etc)</li>
<li>Designed app layout in Android Studio/XML</li>
<li>Created art assets in Photoshop</li>
<li>Published to Google Play Store</li>
</ul>
