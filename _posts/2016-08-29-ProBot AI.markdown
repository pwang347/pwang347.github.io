<h1>Project description</h1>
ProBot is a Protoss-race AI designed for the real-time strategy game Starcraft: Broodwar. For this project I wanted to apply game theory concepts such as minimax (with alpha-beta cutoff) to a real-time game with the use of heuristics. It was also an opportunity for me to practice documentation using Doxygen.

<h1>Responsibilities</h1>
<ul>
<li>Implemented minimax with alpha-beta pruning for build order searching</li>
<li>Implemented tree traversal for a node struct representing tech trees</li>
<li>Implemented custom debugging methods</li>
<li>Implemented modular design for extendability, used UMLet for class diagrams</li>
<li>Designed unit tests for tree traversal (which did not require a live instance in game)</li>
</ul>
