<h1>Project description</h1>
This was a short six-hour hackathon. Our team decided to work on a course requirement checker tree based on a set of course inputs; I was in charge of writing the core backend Python script for scraping course pre-requisites, and converting these into logical groups -- and the data was to be displayed using Django.
Although we didn't finish the application in time, I was happy that I had at least accomplished a script that given an input course code retrieves the logical pre-requisite groups and also implemented a semi-functional pre-requisite comparator with a preset runlist.

It was my first time writing Python, and I definitely feel that it was an enjoyable experience.

<h1>Responsibilities</h1>
<ul>
<li>Implemented web scraping of course directories, navigation to specific course pages</li>
<li>Implemented semantic analysis of course prequisites to create logical object representaitons</li>
<li>Worked on pre-requisite comparison</li>
</ul>
