<h1>Project description</h1>
The theme for this game jam was "Ritual". My team worked on a GearVR game called Routine Collection where the player collects items to progress to the next level (where they must collect the previous items and a new one in the same order) by moving in the direction that they are looking. Our design philosophy for the development of this project was to put out a minimum viable product as early as possible before adding on additional features and graphical effects.

<h1>Responsibilities</h1>
<ul>
<li>Designed and implemented core logic (eg. collectible random spawn, random color, level clear)</li>
<li>Designed helper class for screen fading</li>
<li>Added bloom effects for camera</li>
<li>Added particle systems</li>
</ul>
