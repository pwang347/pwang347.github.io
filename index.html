            </header>
		<p>Hello, my name is Paul Wang and I'm a software developer based in Vacouver B.C.</p>
<p>I'm currently a first year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia. In my spare time, I strive to adopt the latest programming strategies and workflows while designing my own software. Aside from software development though, my interests also include digital painting, game design and music composition.
