<h1>Project description</h1>
Work in progress!

Docker GUI is a web control utility for managing Docker containers and images. While creating a graphical interface for Docker isn't a particularly new idea, most (such as Kubernetes) are designed primarily for cluster orchestration, whereas the purpose of this tool is to provide a user-friendly interface for those unfamiliar with Docker.

The project is in part motivated by the frustration of some co-workers, and a sudden keen interest in Golang and ReactJS.

Quite fittingly, the app itself is also shipped as a Docker container at pwang347/docker-gui.

<h1>Responsibilities</h1>
<ul>
<li>Set up JSON-serving Docker command and healthcheck endpoints through calls to the Golang API implementation</li>
<li>Frontend is designed with ReactJS and the Material UI component library</li>
<li>Fully containerized the app and wrote supporting Bash scripts for customization</li>
</ul>
