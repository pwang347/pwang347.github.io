<h1>Project description</h1>
What you're currently looking at. Heh.

This site uses the Strata Jekyll theme with quite a few tweaks to the CSS styling and overall layout.
The goal of this project was to create a fast, easily-maintainable website to showcase my work. In the future, I may also use this site as a blogging platform for tutorial related posts.

<h1>Responsibilities</h1>
<ul>
<li>Modified CSS and html using the Strata theme as a base</li>
<li>Used AJAX calls to load html into main div so that the header doesn't need to refresh</li>
<li>Hosted site on GitHub Pages</li>
</ul>
